### Unified Recipes

**This mod is WIP**

Intended to fix or enhance other mods in regards to their recipes.

For example you may want to have ten different chairs, but it gets
messy if the various mods define ten different ways to build a chair
especially if they define their own crafting materials for them and
you and up with three different kind of wooden planks that sort of all do the
same thing.

Where possible I try to supplement custom materials by those out of **basic_materials**.
